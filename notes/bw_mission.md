# Building on greatness

During its original launch Black+White quickly became an internationally acclaimed visual arts magazine showcasing the world's best image makers. B+W gave a lens into the craft of photography, fashion and creativity and eventually became as influential as it was renowned. Testimony to B+W's place in culture is the demand the brand commands even now, a full 7 years after its last publication.

# A new environment

Since B+W stopped publishing the world has changed, the iPhone was considered stupid because it didn't have a keyboard, people were still trepidatious 

Facebook had been available to the public for less than a year and no

the biggest measure of innovation is change in behaviour

current behaviour is to think everyone is an artist, living in an overly accessible world 

companies like huff post and buzzfeed are succeeding b/c they appeal to this phenomenon and create link-bate that people click on in social feeds, this is junk food for the masses and not original content

we will appeal to deeper cultural needs, create content that is thought provoking, challenging and pushes culture forward

become a champion for true artists

we're selling a peak into where trends are going
we're selling the evolution of trends
creating cultural wealth in an abundance of ordinary

people with creative vision, uninhibitated by likes or commercial gain

extend to allowing these professionals to come together around a topic/piece of work

fast fashion, simple to use app lenses and instantaneous distribution

online as the channel

scarcity as the value -> let the market decide price

as share/real estate market has floundered "other" assets have skyrocketed in value

importance of the team: attack project from correct angles, the end product (mag) needs to be something people desire, online editorial needs to tell a captivating story, the digital tools need to enable the team

developing an understanding of the customer
